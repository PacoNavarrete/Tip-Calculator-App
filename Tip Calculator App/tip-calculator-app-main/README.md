## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript

### What I learned

I learned so much about Javascript in just this one project. There is a real learning curve from just practicing and following along to tutorials online to actually implementing. I eneded up reworking the Javascript halfway through after realising I had written more code than I had too. 

### Continued development

I really want to do more practice with Javascript. I ran into a couple of problems I haven't been able to solve on my own. 


### Useful resources

I used so many different resources, it would have been too difficult to track, but thankful to google and youtube for getting me through this.
